# Differential Expression Analysis of UV Stress Response in Arabidopsis thaliana (Vasculature)

## Background  
Berkowitz et al. (2021) investigated how different tissues of the *Arabidopsis thaliana* leaf—epidermis, mesophyll, and vasculature—respond to multiple abiotic stresses.  
In our case, we will be determining the genes that respond to **UV stress in the vasculature**.

---

## Objective  
Perform differential expression analysis in the vasculature of **UV-treated tissues** compared with **Water (control)**.
